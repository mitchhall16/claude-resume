# ATS Optimization Reference

## How ATS Systems Work

Applicant Tracking Systems scan resumes for:
1. **Keyword matching** - Exact and semantic matches to job description
2. **Section recognition** - Standard headers like "Experience", "Education", "Skills"
3. **Date parsing** - Employment timeline and gaps
4. **Contact extraction** - Email, phone, location
5. **Qualification scoring** - Years of experience, education level

## Formatting Rules for ATS Compatibility

### DO:
- Use standard section headers: Experience, Education, Skills, Summary
- Use common fonts: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman
- Submit as .docx or .pdf (check job posting for preference)
- Use bullet points with standard characters (•, -, *)
- Include dates in consistent format (MM/YYYY or Month YYYY)
- Put job title and company on separate lines or clearly delimited
- Use text-based email and phone (not images)
- Keep to 1-2 pages

### DON'T:
- Use tables or columns (ATS reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Include graphics, logos, or images
- Use text boxes or headers/footers for critical info
- Use fancy fonts or special characters
- Embed contact info in images
- Use abbreviations without spelling out first (except universal ones like "MBA")

## Keyword Optimization Strategy

### Keyword Density
- Primary skills: Mention 2-3 times naturally throughout resume
- Secondary skills: At least 1 mention each
- Job title: Include exact title or close variation in summary

### Keyword Placement Priority
1. **Professional Summary** - Highest weight
2. **Skills Section** - Direct matches
3. **Job Titles** - Role alignment
4. **Experience Bullets** - Contextual usage
5. **Education/Certifications** - Credential validation

### Keyword Types to Include

**Hard Skills** (technical abilities):
- Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL
- Frameworks: React, Django, Spring Boot, TensorFlow
- Tools: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, DevOps, CI/CD

**Soft Skills** (interpersonal abilities):
- Leadership, Communication, Problem-solving
- Collaboration, Time Management, Adaptability
- Note: Back these up with examples, don't just list

**Certifications & Credentials**:
- Use full name: "Amazon Web Services Certified Solutions Architect"
- Also include abbreviation: "(AWS SAA)"
- Include credential IDs when relevant

**Industry Terms**:
- Use the exact terminology from the job posting
- Include both technical and business terms
- Match the company's language style

## Section-Specific ATS Tips

### Professional Summary
- 2-4 sentences maximum
- Include job title, years of experience, key skills
- Match the target role's language
- Example: "Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable microservices architectures using Python and AWS. Proven track record of leading cross-functional teams and delivering high-impact projects in fintech environments."

### Experience Section
- Format: Job Title | Company Name | Location | Dates
- Start each bullet with an action verb
- Include 3-6 bullets per recent role, 2-3 for older roles
- Quantify achievements with numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
- Mirror job description language naturally

### Skills Section
- Group by category: Technical Skills, Tools, Soft Skills
- List most relevant skills first
- Include both the acronym and full term for important skills
- Don't include basic/assumed skills (Microsoft Office, typing)

### Education Section
- Most recent first
- Include: Degree, Major, Institution, Graduation Year
- GPA only if 3.5+ or specifically requested
- Relevant coursework only if recent graduate

## Common ATS Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Creative formatting** - Looks great to humans, invisible to ATS
2. **Important info in headers/footers** - Often skipped by parsers
3. **Non-standard section names** - "Career Journey" instead of "Experience"
4. **Spelling errors** - Won't match keyword searches
5. **Missing keywords** - Can't match what isn't there
6. **Too many keywords** - Keyword stuffing is detectable
7. **Images instead of text** - Completely unreadable by ATS
8. **Inconsistent date formats** - Confuses date parsing
9. **Generic titles** - "Helped with projects" vs "Led development of..."
10. **Missing contact info** - Must be plain text, not in image
