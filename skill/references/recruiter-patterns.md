# Recruiter Patterns Reference

## The 6-Second Scan

Recruiters spend an average of 6-10 seconds on initial resume review. They scan in this order:

1. **Current/Most Recent Job Title** - Does it match what we need?
2. **Current Company** - Recognizable? Relevant industry?
3. **Start/End Dates** - How long in role? Any gaps?
4. **Education** - Quick check for requirements (degree, certifications)
5. **Skills Section** - Quick keyword scan
6. **First Few Bullets** - Quality and relevance check

### What Makes Recruiters Stop Reading (Positively)
